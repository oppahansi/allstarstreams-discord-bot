        "Please note that you will not be able to post in this Discord for approximately 10 minutes after joining for the first time. Leaving and rejoining the Discord will not bypass this restriction. After that time has passed, you will gain full access to all channels. This is a safety measure to keep our Discord clear of spam, bots, and other online annoyances. During those 10 minutes, we ask that you review the **#rules**, **#vaders-faq**, **#lightstreams-faq**, and **#holo-faq**. You can also check **#announcements** for any info that may pertain to an issue you are having.\n\n" +
        "You can also use the **command sent via your account email** to verify yourself as a **Vader Streams**, **Light Streams**, or **Holodisc** subscriber. This will circumvent the 10 minute restriction and give you instant access. We ask that you do this anyway, as it assists us in addressing any account related issues, and keeps the Discord free of people who are not using it for the intended purpose.\n\n" +
        "**Thank you for joining our community!** In addition to account support, you are free to use the **#off-topic** and General channels to discuss things with the admins, mods, and other users; be it new apps, PPV events, sports, video games, food, travel, weather, whatever. Just be respectful, and above all, have fun!\n\n" +
        "**We appreciate your continued support, and will do our best to make your streaming experience flawless.**";
